Software Definition:
The Appointment software is designed to manage the appointment system for a medical center. The primary goal is to facilitate scheduling, modifying, and canceling appointments for patients.
Key functionalities include:
Appointment Scheduling: Patients can book appointments, which are stored in a central calendar.
Appointment Modification and Cancellation: Users can change or cancel appointments, ensuring up-to-date scheduling.
Calendar Conflict Handling: The system will check for conflicts when creating or editing appointments and notify the user if an overlap occurs.
Patient Management: Each patientâ€™s information is stored in a database, including their appointment history and relevant details.
Appointment Calendar Access: Users can access the appointment calendar, view schedules, and navigate through different timeframes (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
Security Features:
User Authentication: The application will require user authentication to access patient data, ensuring only authorized users can modify or view appointments and patient records. Strong passwords will be enforced, and user roles (e.g., admin, medical staff) will define access permissions.
Data Encryption:
Encryption at Rest: The SQLite database will be encrypted using SQLCipher to protect sensitive patient data stored on disk.
Encryption in Transit: In the case of future network communication, TLS/SSL will be used to ensure data is securely transmitted between clients and servers.

Milestones:
Core Functionality Development (CLI):
Implement core features such as appointment creation, modification, cancellation, and conflict handling.
Set up the patient database with encryption using SQLCipher and implement user authentication.
Migration to Qt (GUI):
Transition the CLI-based application to a Qt-based GUI, maintaining the original functionality with improved user experience.
Add GUI elements for viewing, editing, and managing appointments, as well as patient details.

Technical Stack:
Modern C++ (17): The project will be developed in C++17 to leverage modern language features such as std::optional, std::filesystem, and structured bindings.
SQLite with SQLCipher: A lightweight, encrypted, file-based database to store patient and appointment data securely.
Qt: A cross-platform toolkit for building the graphical user interface (GUI), enabling smooth transitions to a user-friendly design once core functionality is implemented.

User Stories / Use Cases:
As an administrator, I want to be able to add, edit, or delete appointments, so I can manage the clinic's schedule efficiently.
As a medical staff member, I want to view appointments for a specific day, so I can prepare for my appointments.
As a patient, I want to be able to view my appointments and cancel them if needed.

Error Handling and Edge Cases:
Invalid Inputs: The system will notify users if they enter invalid data, such as an incorrect date or time format.
Database Errors: If the application cannot connect to the database or an operation fails, an error message will be displayed, and the user will be prompted to retry.
Appointment Conflicts: The system will automatically detect conflicts when an appointment overlaps with an existing one and inform the user with a suggestion to select another time.

Backup and Recovery:
Database Backups: The system will perform daily encrypted backups of the database to ensure data is protected. Backups will be stored in a secure location.
Recovery Mechanisms: If the database is corrupted or a failure occurs, the system will allow for recovery from the most recent backup.

Performance Considerations:
Optimized Queries: To ensure efficient performance, SQL queries will be optimized, particularly when dealing with a large number of patients and appointments.
UI Responsiveness: The Qt-based GUI will be designed to ensure smooth interaction with the system, even as the number of appointments and patients increases.

Testing Strategy:
Unit Testing: Unit tests will be written for core features such as appointment scheduling, conflict detection, and database interactions.
Integration Testing: The integration between the database and application will be tested to ensure data is properly managed.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): The system will undergo UAT to ensure it meets user expectations and provides a smooth experience for medical staff and patients.

Deployment and Installation (Future Considerations):
Installation: The application will be easy to install with minimal dependencies. The SQLite database will be embedded with the application, and no additional setup will be required.
Software Updates: Future updates will be distributed through patch versions, and the software will notify users of available updates.

System Limitations:
Scalability: The current design is intended for small to medium-sized clinics. If the software is deployed to a larger facility, performance optimizations may be required.
Network Features: Network features, such as syncing appointments or multi-location support, are not included in the initial version but may be considered in future releases.
